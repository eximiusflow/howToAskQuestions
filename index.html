  <h1>How To Ask Questions</h1>
  <p>Asking questions is a very important skill for a developer. However, in your career you won't always have someone to give you all of the answers. Part of being a developer is getting really good at something we call problem solving. It is often the most overlooked skill to practice by a beginner. In this course, we want to work on the skills that matter, so moving forward, I have a request for you that will have long term positive effects on your career:</p>
  <p><trong>If you have a question or you don't understand something, do these things in order:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Try Rubber Ducking: <a href="https://rubberduckdebugging.com/" target="_blank">https://rubberduckdebugging.com/</a> (all great programmers I know do this)</li>
    <li>Use google and websites like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">stackoverflow</a> (there is a video coming up on this) to find your answer. Most likely somebody has had your issue before.</li>
